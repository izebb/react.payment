# react.payment

Port of Stripe's [jquery.payment](https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment) library to ReactJS.

The code requires additional clean-up, and is incomplete. So you probably shouldn't use it yet ;)

Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

Use webpack to build:
```
$ webpack --watch
```

To test, run a local web server and open index.html
